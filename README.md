# Sacha-Marciano
 Hi, I am Sacha, an aspiring full stack developer.
 Let's share my learning journey together !
 On my profile you can find the projects I've been working on during my studies, don't hesitate to take a look, you will find all the info in the README :) !

My projects are built using different techs, some are pure HTML and CSS (the good days of discovering the frontend world), some are spiced with a bit of Javascript and the latest are built with React CRA using 80% jsx.
I also have two backend project built with Express, and running on Google Cloud Virtual Machines. They run 24/7 thanks to the PM2 package and I used the cors,helmet,bycrypt,and rate-limiter packages for security. All the data is store on a MongoDB database right on the VM.
