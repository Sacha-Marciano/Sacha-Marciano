# Sacha-Marciano
 Hi, I am Sacha, a full-stack developer with a passion for building impactful applications.

## My Journey

What started as a fascination with HTML and CSS during my early days has grown into a deep expertise in full-stack development. I've moved from simple front-end pages to complex, fully-fledged applications that serve real-world needs. My journey reflects a continuous evolution, taking on bigger challenges and pushing the boundaries of what I can create.

## Key Projects

### HelpEat

One of my proudest achievements is HelpEat, a comprehensive application designed to simplify meal planning and grocery shopping. Built with the MERN stack, HelpEat allows users to share recipes, create weekly eating schedules, and generate shopping lists, making meal preparation seamless and collaborative.

### Learning Management System (LMS)

I've also developed a full-featured Learning Management System, designed to enhance the educational experience for both students and instructors. This project involved everything from front-end user interfaces to robust back-end functionalities, showcasing my ability to handle end-to-end development.

### Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

Currently, I'm building a CRM system tailored for businesses to manage their customer interactions efficiently. This project highlights my commitment to creating solutions that not only meet but exceed user expectations.
